# planet
A simulation that simulates geological processes as well as hydrological, biological, and other complex systems that can exist on a planet.

# Building
Simply run Ant on the root directory where the build XML file is located. Newer versions of the project will eventually move to Maven

# IDE
The current version is using NetBeans 8.0.2 hence the nbproject directory.

# Project Status
Right now the project is in clean and maintance mode with some minor additions and changes to the code. More unit tests must be written before any
more newer code is written. There is no GUI at the moment and when code revisions are finished a basic GUI will be built.

# Contributors
If you wish to contribute to the project, I'm looking for those skilled in 3D graphics. The simulation will be using LWJGL.
